As a creative person, I wanted to find a way for my ideas to have a more significant impact in the world. Technology has the capacity to help creatives and innovators bring their ideas to life. I always wished that when I had a crazy idea, I would have some idea on how to make it happen. I want to create positive change in people's lives and inspire more people to realize that software engineering is something they can do too. Learning how to code over the past 2 years has shown be that there is a way for me to bring those ideas to life. Being an engineer means not only solving hard problems, but eliminiting problems for other people, and that's what I hope to do.
