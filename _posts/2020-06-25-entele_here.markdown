Over the last ten months, Flatiron has been part of my daily life. From lectures, lessons, labs, pair programming and projects, although this course is part-time, it took up a large portion of my life. I had studied code before starting Flatiron, but the consistency and accountablility that I received from the Flatiron curriculum is what I needed to build a strong skillset. I have a confidence that I didn't have before finishing this course, and for the first time in my life I feel like I'm ready to start building a career. 

My biggest piece of advice to people starting to learn coding, is that it's okay to start over. I studied Java for a year prior to Flatiron, but felt like I didn't have a strong foundation and like there were so many gaps in my knowledge. I also knew that I didn't like Java but I loved coding. I decided to do a more structured program and start with a new language, and that is when I applied to Flatiron, which has been one of the best decisions I've made.
